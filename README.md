# Reddit Bot Assessment - Complete Implementation

A sophisticated Reddit bot that automatically scans subreddits, detects relevant posts using keyword matching, and generates contextual responses using Google's Gemini AI. Built for the Pelton AI Bot Developer position assessment.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete Reddit automation solution that:
- Monitors r/india and r/AskReddit subreddits for new posts
- Intelligently identifies posts needing assistance using keyword detection
- Generates helpful, human-like responses using Gemini LLM
- Implements anti-spam measures to avoid detection
- Logs all interactions to a local SQLite database
- Provides a modern GUI for easy control and monitoring

## Quick Start

### 1. Environment Setup

```bash
# Clone/download the project
mkdir reddit-bot-assessment && cd reddit-bot-assessment

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# .venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install praw google-generativeai customtkinter python-dotenv
```

### 2. API Credentials Setup

**Reddit API:**
1. Go to https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps
2. Create a new "script" application
3. Note your client_id and client_secret

**Gemini API:**
1. Visit https://aistudio.google.com/
2. Generate a free API key

### 3. Configure Credentials

Edit the credentials in `reddit_bot_template.py`:

```python
self.config = {
    'reddit': {
        'client_id': 'your_reddit_client_id',
        'client_secret': 'your_reddit_client_secret',
        'user_agent': 'reddit_bot_v1.0 by /u/your_username',
        'username': 'your_bot_username',
        'password': 'your_bot_password'
    },
    'gemini': {
        'api_key': 'your_gemini_api_key'
    }
}
```

### 4. Run the Bot

**Command Line (Core Bot):**
```bash
python3 reddit_bot_template.py
```

**GUI Application (Recommended):**
```bash
python3 app.py
```

## Core Bot Features (`reddit_bot_template.py`)

### Intelligent Post Detection
- Scans r/india and r/AskReddit every 10 minutes (configurable)
- Detects posts containing help-seeking keywords: "help", "advice", "question", "how to", "confused", "stuck", "problem", "issue", "guidance"
- Filters posts by age (only responds to posts under 1 hour old)
- Avoids duplicate responses using in-memory tracking

### Advanced Response Generation
```python
def generate_response(self, post, keywords):
    prompt = f"""You are a curious and helpful Redditor. Instead of just giving a direct answer, 
    your goal is to help the original poster think through their problem by asking insightful questions, 
    while still providing a bit of guidance.
    
    **Instructions**
    * You are thoughtful and encouraging.
    * You lead with questions before offering a strong opinion.
    * Your tone is conversational and friendly.
    * Be direct, practical, and genuinely helpful. Sound like a real person, not an AI.
    """
```

### Anti-Spam Protection
- **Rate Limiting**: 2 seconds between Reddit API calls, 12 seconds between Gemini calls
- **Human-like Delays**: Random 30-60 second delays before posting responses
- **Quality Filters**: Only responds to posts with positive engagement scores
- **Selective Responses**: Responds to ~5-10% of scanned posts, not every post

### Database Logging
- **Interactions Table**: Logs every response attempt with timestamp, subreddit, post details, keywords found, bot response, and success status
- **Performance Metrics**: Tracks scanning efficiency and response rates
- **SQLite Database**: Lightweight, file-based storage for easy analysis

## GUI Application Features (`app.py`)

The CustomTkinter GUI provides a professional interface for bot management:

### Configuration Controls
- **Subreddit Selection**: Choose between "india", "AskReddit", or "both"
- **Scan Frequency**: Toggle between hourly and weekly scanning modes
- **Test Interval**: Override timing with custom seconds for development
- **Keywords Management**: Edit trigger keywords through a text area
- **Real-time Validation**: Checks subreddit existence before starting

### Live Monitoring
- **Status Indicator**: Visual feedback on bot running state
- **Live Logs Tab**: Real-time streaming of bot activity logs
- **Heartbeat Messages**: Periodic status updates during long waits
- **Start/Stop Controls**: Graceful bot control with immediate response

### Database Management
- **Database Viewer**: Browse all logged interactions in a clean table format
- **Refresh Function**: Update the view with latest database entries
- **Clear Database**: Remove all stored records with confirmation
- **Auto-refresh**: Periodically updates the database view

### Threading Architecture
```python
def _run_loop(self):
    """GUI-managed bot loop with responsive stop control"""
    while not self.stop_event.is_set():
        self.bot.run_hourly_scan()
        
        # Sleep in 1-second increments for immediate stop response
        for _ in range(cycle_delay):
            if self.stop_event.is_set():
                break
            time.sleep(1)
```

## Assessment Requirements Compliance

✅ **Keyword Detection**: Comprehensive keyword matching in titles and content  
✅ **LLM Integration**: Advanced Gemini API integration with custom prompts  
✅ **Quality Standards**: Natural, helpful responses that avoid spam detection  
✅ **Database Logging**: Complete SQLite logging of all interactions  
✅ **Rate Limiting**: Proper API management with delays and limits  
✅ **Anti-Spam Measures**: Random delays, selective responses, human-like behavior  

## Technical Implementation Details

### Reddit API Integration
```python
def setup_reddit(self):
    self.reddit = praw.Reddit(
        client_id=self.config['reddit']['client_id'],
        client_secret=self.config['reddit']['client_secret'],
        user_agent=self.config['reddit']['user_agent'],
        username=self.config['reddit']['username'],
        password=self.config['reddit']['password']
    )
```

### Gemini LLM Integration
- Model: `gemini-2.5-flash` for fast, cost-effective responses
- Rate limiting: 5 requests/minute compliance with free tier
- Custom prompting for conversational, helpful responses
- Error handling with graceful fallbacks

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE interactions (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    timestamp TEXT,
    subreddit TEXT,
    post_id TEXT,
    post_title TEXT,
    post_content TEXT,
    keywords_found TEXT,
    bot_response TEXT,
    response_length INTEGER,
    success BOOLEAN
);
```

## Usage Examples

### Running Core Bot
```bash
# Start the bot with default settings
python3 reddit_bot_template.py

# View logs in real-time
tail -f reddit_bot.log

# Check database
sqlite3 reddit_bot.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM interactions;"
```

### Using GUI Application
1. Launch: `python3 app.py`
2. Configure subreddits and keywords
3. Set test interval (e.g., 120 seconds for development)
4. Click "Start" to begin bot operation
5. Monitor live logs and database entries
6. Use "Stop" for graceful shutdown

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Log Analysis
```bash
# View recent successful responses
sqlite3 reddit_bot.db "SELECT timestamp, subreddit, post_title FROM interactions WHERE success=1 ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 10;"

# Check response rate
sqlite3 reddit_bot.db "SELECT COUNT(*) as total, SUM(success) as successful FROM interactions;"
```

### Performance Metrics

- **Webhook Support**: Real-time notifications and external triggers  
- **API Endpoints**: RESTful API for external control and monitoring
- **Database Migration**: PostgreSQL support for high-volume operations
- **Load Balancing**: Multiple bot instances with centralized coordination

### Advanced AI Features
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze post emotion before responding
- **Topic Modeling**: Specialized responses based on post categories
