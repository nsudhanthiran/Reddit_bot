These IIMs **do** place students into these roles, but it's highly competitive.\n",

However, CFA L1 alone is not a substitute for a top B-school MBA for the high-end IB/Consulting roles. Think of it as a strong *supplement* to your profile, not the primary gateway. Higher CFA levels are more valued, but primarily in specific investment management roles, not typically for entry into IB/Consulting via campus recruitment.\n",

Also, focus on gaining relevant internships (even with smaller firms or startups) to build practical experience and show genuine interest.\n",
